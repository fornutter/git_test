Application for a visiting Ph. D. position
Dear Prof. xxx:

My name is Jianguo Liu, a 2nd year Ph.D. candidate from Shandong University, P. R. China, supervised by Prof. Shu-Cai Li. My research mainly concerns with the treatment for the water and mud inrush of underground engineering. During my research, I found our research areas have a lot in common, so I am writing to inquire if you have an open position for me as a visiting Ph.D. student. 

I¡¯m supported by China Scholarship Council. This 12-month program aims to provide financial aid for excellent Ph.D. students to study abroad and it will cover all the living and international travel cost that I need in your group.

During my research, I found you have published quite a lot of high level scientific papers and some of them gave me a lot of inspiration. Your research in this field attracts me, so I am very desired to get a chance to enter your group as a visiting Ph.D. student.

Our research group has undertaken 12 treatment projects in China. By participating in those projects, I did research on more efficient treatment methods for the water and mud inrush of underground engineering, including grouting mechanism of quick setting slurry, failure of minerals and rocks, as well as multiphase flow. I also have participated in the disaster control of Yonglian tunnel, Daba tunnel and Shunhe tunnel and developed several large-scale model tests about disaster control.


Please find my CV attached.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration. I look forward to your reply.

Kind Regards,

Jianguo Liu
